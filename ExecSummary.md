Opensource software applications are becoming increasingly popular Lower costs, access to source code, lower costs, more control for users, higher quality, and better support as the reasons for using OSS (Derick and West, 2004). Although the source code of open source software is available for modification, it is protected by licenses and softwares. It is very essential for corporate managers and corporate developers to manage the code and project information. Having complete knowledge of all the licenses and vulnerabilities of a given open source software helps organizations to fulfill their ethical responsibilities.

This project deals with developing a system that will help organizations to gain complete knowledge of the open source soft wares they want to use from license, copyright and vulnerabilities point of view. This project contains data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams and use cases for the proposed system. We hope that the system acts as a facilitator between the organization and the external open source communities.
