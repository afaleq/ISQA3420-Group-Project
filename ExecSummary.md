Open source software applications are becoming increasingly popular. Access to source code, lower costs, more control for users, higher quality, and better support are some of the reasons for using OSS (Derick and West, 2004). Although the source code of open source software is available for modification, it is protected by licenses and copyrights. It is very essential for corporate managers and corporate developers to manage the code and license information. Having complete knowledge of all the licenses and vulnerabilities of a given piece of open source software helps organizations to fulfill their legal and ethical responsibilities.

This project deals with developing a system that will help organizations to gain complete knowledge of the licenses, copyrights and vulnerabilities of the open source software they want to use. This project contains data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams and use cases for the proposed system. We hope that the system acts as a facilitator between the organization and the external open source communities.
